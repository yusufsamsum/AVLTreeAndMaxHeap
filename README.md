# AVL Tree And Max Heap in C++
There are two data structure implementations in this repository. One of them is AVL Tree and it includes its rotation analysis.

Another one is max heap and it includes number of swap analysis.

You are encouraged to use "input.txt" folder so you can test the max heap implementation.

This implementation's intension is practising AVL Tree and Max Heap implementations in C++. It is a programming assigment of fundemental structures in computer science in Bilkent.


for both folder Makefile goes like:
		make -f Makefile
		./hw3
